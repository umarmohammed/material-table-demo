This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Material Table

Material table with 10k rows and 20 columns makes the table unresponsive. It seems like it doesn't use the cdk virtual scroll however it can be customised to do so.

See https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/10122 for more information
See https://stackblitz.com/edit/mat-table-virtual-scroll for an example.
